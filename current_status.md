# Current Status

## Next task — field-test remediation

Execute [docs/field-test-remediation-plan.md](docs/field-test-remediation-plan.md).

The current working tree contains a partial implementation of the latest field-test feedback, but it is not ready to ship. The next task must:

1. Restore compilation by fixing the extra closing brace in `TestsView.swift`.
2. Preserve coach prescriptions per exercise and per set, including distinct rep ladders and weights.
3. Make pending sets performer-specific so adding a partner adds that partner's complete set plan.
4. Resolve partner defaults from exact exercise history, then the partner's general rep pattern, then the planned fallback—at workout start and after exercise swaps.
5. Put each Tests category in one glass surface with standard top-level margins.
6. Complete collapsed strength summaries with reps, weights, and partner names while keeping all controls expansion-only.
7. Make Workouts Today distinguish completed records from remaining coach plans, including partial two-a-days.
8. Add focused logic/UI coverage and finish with successful package tests, app build, smoke/guardrail checks, and simulator visual verification.

Do not mark this task complete from the current partial diff. The detailed plan records the known defects, schema approach, implementation phases, acceptance criteria, test matrix, verification commands, and final checklist.

## Field-testing follow-up

This follow-up addresses the remaining UI issues found after the Home field test:

- Watch sync feedback is inset below the safe area so the startup toast is fully visible.
- Home Start Workout and Log Previous Workout use the same 20-point section spacing as the surrounding Home sections.
- Start Workout now labels the just-in-time editing route `Custom Workout`.
- Workout Plan puts its full-width `Start Workout` control above the list as a standalone action.
- Productive Coach volume suggestions whose insight says `volume is on track` use the green positive treatment; low/high volume remains warning-colored.

Focused presenter and iPhone smoke coverage verify the productive-volume tone and custom-workout label. The CI smoke job covers the complete navigation surface.

## Home field-testing checklist

The Home View field test identified these issues, which are the acceptance criteria for this batch:

1. Rename the Coach suggestion workout to `Suggested Workout` and use the subtitle `Coach created a Workout created to close gaps for this week`.
2. Make `This Week` expand in place. On expansion, hide the `Weekly Volume` heading, start with `Legs`, and put `Show less` at the bottom. Capitalize `Coach’s Suggestions`; keep each suggestion collapsed by default, independently expandable, and color-coded green for positive, yellow for warning, and white for neutral.
3. Apply the same green/yellow state color coding to Weekly Volume body-part rows.
4. Remove the separate `What you did` section. Put this week’s Strength and Cardio workout details inside expanded `This Week`, add `View more…` for complete history, then show weekly volume and `Show less`.
5. Make Strength `Quick Start` enter warm-up/the workout directly without the plan or settings surface.
6. Make Home `Start Workout` full width and put `Log Previous Workout` below it; use Progress View’s Full History for complete history.

## Implementation status — complete

- Home now uses one expandable This Week card for workout details, history navigation, and weekly volume.
- Coach suggestions use the requested copy, independent expansion, and semantic positive/warning/neutral colors.
- Quick Start bypasses plan/settings UI and enters the configured warm-up or active strength session.
- Home actions have the requested layout; duplicate Home Workout History remains removed because Progress View owns Full History.
- Presenter unit coverage now verifies weekly grouping and suggestion/body-part state mapping.
- The iPhone smoke test verifies Home expansion, plan navigation, direct Quick Start, no settings surface, workout completion, and summary return.

## Final audit

- [x] Suggested Workout copy and the requested gap-closing subtitle are present.
- [x] This Week expands in place; Show more is replaced by Show less, the expanded volume starts with Legs, and there is no Weekly Volume heading in the Home composition.
- [x] Coach’s Suggestions is capitalized; suggestions are independently expandable, collapsed by default, and tone-coded.
- [x] Weekly Volume rows use green for productive range and yellow for below/above range.
- [x] What you did is no longer a Home section; expanded This Week contains Strength and Cardio, complete-history navigation, volume, total volume, and Show less.
- [x] Strength Quick Start bypasses plan/settings UI and enters warm-up or the active workout.
- [x] Start Workout is full width, Log Previous Workout is below it, and Home does not duplicate Progress View’s Full History.
